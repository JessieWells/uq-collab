## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, warning=F, message=F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=pressure, aes(x=temperature, y=pressure))+
  geom_point(aes(color=pressure))
```
